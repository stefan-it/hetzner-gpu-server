# Hetzner GPU Server Setup

This repository hosts my cheatsheet for Hetzner GPU Server Setup. Hopefully, I could also be useful for others ;)

## GEX44

In March 2024, Hetzner thanksfully released a new [generation of GPU servers](https://www.hetzner.com/press-release/new-gpu-server/), after their [first GPU server](https://web.archive.org/web/20210613172423/https://www.hetzner.com/news/blitzschnell-gestochen-scharf-neuer-dedicated-root-server-ex51-ssd-gpu/) back in March 2017!

The GEX44 comes with an Intel® Core™ i5-13500, 64GB of RAM and a NVIDIA RTX™ 4000 with 20GB GPU-RAM.

I will use the GPU mainly for fine-tuning NLP models with the awesome [Flair](https://github.com/flairNLP/flair) library. I am very excited about the new GEX44 server, as I've also used the old GPU server back in 2017 for releasing a lot of [Flair Embeddings](https://github.com/flairNLP/flair-lms)!
